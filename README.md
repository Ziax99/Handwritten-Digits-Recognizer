# Handwritten-Digits-Recognizer
A Convolutional Neural Network model to recognize handwritten digits trained on the famous MNIST dataset.

Used Normalization and Augmentation for preprocessing data and designed 3-layers convolutional neural network to achieve 99.5% accuracy on the test set.

Created as a solution for kaggle competition mnist dataset (top 19%)
